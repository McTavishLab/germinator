# This file derives from the file /etc/apache2/sites-available/default
# in apache2 as installed in ubuntu 12.04.

# We support both HTTP and HTTPS, with two separate files in sites-available.
# This file holds only the settings unique to the HTTP VirtualHost, with all
# shared configuration included from 'apache-confog-shared'. See

# This file should be periodically reviewed as apache versions advance and
#  'best practice' for virtual host configurations changes.
