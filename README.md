otbootstrap
==============

Scripts for setting up databases and performing common tasks.

Eventually, the hope is that these tools can be leveraged to automate spawning of new database instances for curation, development, and general use.

For now, these tools should at least help simplify tedious, repetitive tasks.

setup_otu.sh
------------

Just a very basic script to setup the simple prototype editor and run it in a web browser.

setup_taxomachine.sh
------------

A more fully-featured script to facilitate installing taxomachine, building a taxonomy database, and running taxonomy services. Run it with the flag --help for information on options.
