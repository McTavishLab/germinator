otbootstrap
==============

Scripts for setting up databases and performing common tasks.

Eventually, the hope is that these tools can be leveraged to automate spawning of new database instances for curation, development, and general use.

For now, these tools should at least help simplify tedious, repetitive tasks.

setup_otu.sh
------------

Just a very basic script that will download, set up, and run the simple prototype editor (it will open the editor in a web browser). This script will probably only work out-of-the-box on linux.

setup_taxomachine.sh
------------

A more fully-featured script to facilitate installing taxomachine, building a taxonomy database, and running taxonomy services. Run it with the '--help' flag for information on options.
