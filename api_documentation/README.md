To generate documentation for the Open Tree APIS, just run the following command in a terminal:

```
python make_documentation.py
```

This will print the docs (in github markdown format) to standard output.

It requires pycurl.

If you found this page because you want to read the API docs, rather than install and build them, see https://github.com/OpenTreeOfLife/opentree/wiki/Open-Tree-of-Life-APIs .
