# Sample deployment configuration file.  Modify for your own purposes.

# Create one file per host, and use each with the deployment tool e.g.
#   ./push.sh -c myserver.config
# These parameters can be overridden using arguments to push.sh.
# See also README.md in this directory.

# -----
# OPENTREE_HOST is the host that you're going to initialize or update.
# This is used as a target for ssh, and the name also ends up getting
# stored in the web2py configuration
# applications/opentree/private/config for use in server
# authentication.

OPENTREE_HOST=ec2-12-345-678-901.us-west-2.compute.amazonaws.com

# -----
# OPENTREE_IDENTITY is the name of the file containing the ssh private
# key used to log in to OPENTREE_HOST as the admin user (see
# OPENTREE_ADMIN, below).  Defaults to opentree.pem.

# OPENTREE_IDENTITY=opentree.pem

# -----
# OPENTREE_NEO4J_HOST is the name of the server to contact for neo4j
# (treemachine, taxomachine, oti) requests.  The Javascript code needs
# to know this.
#
# TO BE DONE, perhaps: Split this up so that the different services
# can reside on different hosts.

OPENTREE_NEO4J_HOST=ec2-21-345-876-901.us-west-2.compute.amazonaws.com

# -----
# OPENTREE_ADMIN is the name of the privileged admin user, the one
# that can do 'sudo' commands.  This is not to be confused with the
# unprivileged 'opentree' user.  Should be 'admin' if the installed OS
# is Debian (the default), or 'ubuntu' if the OS is Ubuntu (as was the
# case for the first two EC2 machines we set up).

# OPENTREE_ADMIN=admin
